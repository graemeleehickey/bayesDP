Description: Functions for data augmentation using the
    Bayesian discount prior method for single arm and two-arm clinical trials,
    as described in Haddad et al. (2017) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2017.1300907>.
    The discount power prior methodology was developed in collaboration with
    the The Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC) Computer Modeling & 
    Simulation Working Group.

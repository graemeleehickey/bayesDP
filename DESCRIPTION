Description: Functions for data augmentation using the Bayesian discount prior 
    method for single arm and two-arm clinical trials, as described in Haddad 
    et al. (2017) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2017.1300907>. The discount power prior 
    methodology was developed in collaboration with the The Medical Device 
    Innovation Consortium (MDIC) Computer Modeling & Simulation Working Group.
